In the project directory at terminal please start with following commands:

### npm install --save
This command will add all the necessary node modules.

### npm install papaparse --save
This command will install csv parser module.

### npm install react-xml-parser --save
This command will install xml parser module.

### npm install sheetjs-style --save
This command will install utility that will help in generating excel report.

### npm install file-saver --save
This command will install utility to save(download) file that we have generated.

### npm install --dev jest enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 @types/jest
1. jest is the test runner and framework that executes our tests and providers helper functions for assertions
2. enzyme is a test helper library that enables us to render React components on a virtual DOM and provides method to inspect the DOM tree for specific 	components and their properties. Think of JQuery but for React components for testing.
3. enzyme-adapter-react-16 is an adapter between React and Enzyme. This will be executed before running the tests.
4. @types/jest is types library that provides typing and intellisence for global jest keywords such as describe and it in our test file. This makes type safety more robust for type files and provides better IDE support for test files.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
